These scripts can be used to run Fun4All on all threads in a single node. Any other script can be called from "parallel_EIC_shifter.sh" very easily, with the caveat that you are limited to a single node where the memory is shared.

For multi-node use, please see the mpi_parallel directory.

To run on CORI:

`salloc -N 1 -C haswell -q interactive -t 04:00:00`
`module load parallel`
`./parallel_EIC_shifter.sh NEVENTS`
